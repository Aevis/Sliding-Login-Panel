## ABOUT

Joomla module adaption of Jeremie Tisseau's great [Sliding Login Panel] (http://web-kreation.com/all/nice-clean-sliding-login-panel-built-with-jquery/). I was looking for a Joomla 1.6+
working Top Panel module and couldn't find any for free. There's even a straight copy of Jeremie's which
they also charge for. Silly world..
