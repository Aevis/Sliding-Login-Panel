## ABOUT

Joomla module adaption of Jeremie Tisseau's great [Sliding Login Panel] (http://web-kreation.com/all/nice-clean-sliding-login-panel-built-with-jquery/). I was looking for a Joomla 1.6+
working Top Panel module and couldn't find any for free. There's even a straight copy of Jeremie's which
they also charge for. Silly world..

## Requirements

Joomla 1.6+. Untested on earlier versions of Joomla.

## Installation

Zip the mod_sliding_login_panel folder and install it through Joomla's Extension Manager. I've also added
Ant build files for easier extension developing. Check [this link](http://docs.joomla.org/Building_Joomla_Extensions_with_Apache_Ant/) for more info.
